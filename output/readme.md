This folder contains the .ris and .csv files that are generated by the code in the source folder. In our case these are the following different types so far:
- the total list of fetched artics in all_results.ris
- query results as csv-files (named by the search query they describe)
- an overview markdown with some summary statistics (overview.md)
- overviews of the symmetric differences between two queries
