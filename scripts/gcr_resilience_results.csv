These effects were considerably larger for countries with higher levels of preparedness to health risks.\"" \""The negative trend in the level of preparedness to health risks would suggest that there is a need for better preparedness during pandemics by conflating national health with global health risks.\""""",13561_2023_Article_428.pdf
